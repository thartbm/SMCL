# SMCL
Utilities for common data analysis tasks in the SensoriMotor Control Lab.

## Installing the package in R

First do: 

`install.packages('devtools','Rcpp')`

Then install with: 

`devtools::install_github("thartbm/SMCL")`

If you don't have it yet, this will also ask you to install Rtools, and then you might have to run the command again.
