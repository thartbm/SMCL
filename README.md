## Installing the package in R

You can install packages from github with `devtools`: 

`install.packages('devtools')`
`devtools::install_github("thartbm/SMCL")`

While `devtools` is very useful, there are a lot of dependencies involved. So you could consider using `remotes`:

`install.packages('remotes')`
`remotes::install_github('thartbm/SMCL')`
