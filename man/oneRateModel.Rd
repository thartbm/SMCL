\title{Evaluate a one-rate model given parameters and a reach deviation
schedule.}
\usage{
oneRateModel(par, schedule)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{A named vector with the two model parameters (see details).}

\item{schedule}{A vector of length N with the perturbation schedule.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one column, and N rows, so that each row has the 
output of the process on each trial as well as the total system output.
}
\description{
This function is part of a set of functions to fit and 
evaluate the one-rate model of motor learning.
}
\details{
The `par` argument is a named numeric vector that should have the
following elements:
- L: the learning rate
- R: the retention rate
