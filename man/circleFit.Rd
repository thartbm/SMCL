\title{Get origin for points that should fall on a circle}
\usage{
circleFit(x, y, radius = 12)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The x-coordinates of the data.}

\item{y}{The y-coordinates of the data.}

\item{radius}{The radius of the circle the data should fall on. Usually we 
have data in centimeters, and movements of 12 centimeters.}
}
\value{
A vector with an x and y coordinate best fitting the circle.
}
\description{
This utility function can be used to see used to find the 
optimal central point, where optimal means finding the location where
the mean distance of each data point to the central point matches the given
radius best.
