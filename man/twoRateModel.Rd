\title{Evaluate the two-rate model given parameters and a reach deviation
schedule.}
\usage{
twoRateModel(par, schedule)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{A named vector with the four model parameters (see details).}

\item{schedule}{A vector of length N with the perturbation schedule.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns: `slow`, `fast` and `total` and N 
rows, so that each row has the output of the slow and fast process on each
trials as well as the total system output.
}
\description{
This function is part of a set of functions to fit and 
evaluate the two-rate model of motor learning.
}
\details{
The `par` argument is a named numeric vector that should have the
following elements:
- Ls: the slow learning rate
- Lf: the fast learning rate
- Rs: the slow retention rate
- Rf: the fast retention rate
}
