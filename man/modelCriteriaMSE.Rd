\title{Calculate several model evaluation criteria.}
\usage{
modelCriteriaMSE(MSE, k, N)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSE}{numeric: The mean squared error between the model and data. This
can be a vector if multiple models are to be evaluated. If this vector has
named entries, they will be used as row names in the returned data frame.}

\item{k}{numeric: The number of parameters in the model. If MSE is a vector
k needs to be a vector of the same length.}

\item{N}{numeric: the number of independent observations (see the function:
`seriesEffectiveSampleSize` for some options. (Not a vector.)}
}
\value{
data frame with values for several model evaluation criteria
}
\description{
This function is part of a set of functions to fit and 
evaluate the two-rate model of motor learning.
}
\details{
This function allows estimating model criteria based on the MSE. This is
useful for models where no method exists to extract the log-likelihood. When
log-likelihood can be used, see `AIC`, `logLik` and `nobs` from {stats}.

The function calculates four model evaluation criteria:

"AIC": Akaike's Information Criterion

"AICc": The AIC, but with a correction for small sample sizes.

"BIC": The Bayesian Information Criterion

"HQC": The Hannan-Quinn criterion

If there are 2 or more models evaluated, the relative likelihoods of the 
models, based on each criterion are also returned.

\examples{
# get example data:
data("tworatedata")

# first we baseline it, and get a median for every trial:
baseline <- function(reachvector,blidx) reachvector - mean(reachvector[blidx], na.rm=TRUE)
tworatedata[,4:ncol(tworatedata)] <- apply(tworatedata[,4:ncol(tworatedata)], FUN=baseline, MARGIN=c(2), blidx=c(17:32))
reaches <- apply(tworatedata[4:ncol(tworatedata)], FUN=median, MARGIN=c(1), na.rm=TRUE)

# and we extract the schedule:
schedule <- tworatedata$schedule

# now we can fit the model to the reaches, given the schedule:
par <- twoRateFit(schedule, reaches)
MSE2 <- twoRateMSE(par, schedule, reaches)

# we do the same for the one-rate model:
par <- oneRateFit(schedule, reaches)
MSE1 <- oneRateMSE(par, schedule, reaches)

modelCriteriaMSE(MSE=c('one-rate'=MSE1, 'two-rate'=MSE2), k=c(2,4), N=6)
